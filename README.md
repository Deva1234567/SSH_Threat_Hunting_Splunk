# SSH_Threat_Hunting_Splunk
Built a Splunk-based security analytics dashboard to detect and analyze SSH activity (inbound attempts, failed logins, lateral movement, protocol mismatches, and possible C2 beaconing) from simulated log data (secure_logs). The project involved field extraction using rex, creating detection queries, and visualizing results in Splunk dashboards.
